Description: An easy to use tool that can compare splicing events in
    tumor and normal tissue samples using either a user generated matrix, or
    data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This package generates a matrix of 
    splicing outliers that are significantly over or underexpressed in tumors
    samples compared to normal denoted by chromosome location. The package also
    will calculate the splicing burden in each tumor and characterize the 
    types of splicing events that occur.
